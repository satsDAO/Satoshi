## Fun Fact

Did you know? "Sat" not only stands for Satoshi, Bitcoin's smallest unit, but in the ancient Buddhist numeric system, it represents a tiny fraction, precisely 1e-8. This serendipitous match highlights how ancient wisdom can sometimes echo in the digital age, reminding us of the timeless nature of small beginnings leading to significant impacts.
